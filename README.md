# Quantum Bucket Sort

## Overview

**Quantum Bucket Sort** is a novel sorting algorithm that combines principles of partitioning and parallel processing to achieve efficient sorting of large datasets. Inspired by bucket sort and quantum-inspired strategies, this algorithm offers a unique approach to sorting, aiming to outperform traditional sorting methods in specific contexts, particularly with large arrays that exhibit some natural ordering.

## Features

- **Efficient Partitioning**: Utilizes a sampling technique to define boundaries for buckets, allowing for efficient distribution of elements based on quantiles.
- **Parallel Processing**: Sorts individual buckets concurrently, leveraging multi-core processors to reduce overall sorting time.
- **Adaptive Performance**: Designed to perform well on datasets with natural clusters or distributions, improving efficiency in such cases.

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Bucket Partitioning
Quantum Bucket Sort begins by randomly sampling a subset of the input array to establish quantile-based boundaries. This sampling allows the algorithm to define multiple buckets, each representing a range of values. 

### 2. Element Distribution
Elements from the input array are assigned to the appropriate buckets based on these boundaries. The assignment is done in a single pass, making it efficient.

### 3. Parallel Bucket Sorting
Each bucket is sorted concurrently using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This parallel sorting allows for significant performance gains, particularly on large datasets.

### 4. Merging Sorted Buckets
Once all buckets are sorted, the algorithm merges them into a single sorted array. The merging process is efficient due to the fact that the buckets are already partially ordered.

## Performance Comparison

To demonstrate the effectiveness of Quantum Bucket Sort, the algorithm is compared against well-known sorting algorithms, including:

- **Built-in Timsort**: Python's highly optimized sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm known for its stability.

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a random array
arr = np.random.randint(0, 10000, 10000).tolist()

# Sorting using Quantum Bucket Sort
sorted_arr = quantum_sort(arr)

# Output the sorted array
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```
